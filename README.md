##Description
This assignment uses data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's storm database. The database documents major storms and weather 
events in the United States from 1950-2011 and tracks key characteristics such
as date and location of the storm, number of fatalities/injuries, and estimates
of property and crop damage. Throughout the course of the analysis, the data is
summed by storm type and then scaled to a per year value.

##Assignment

The data analysis must address the following questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect 
to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic 
consequences?
